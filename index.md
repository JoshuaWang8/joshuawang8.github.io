### [apha.ai: Support for Aphasia Patients](https://github.com/JoshuaWang8/apha-ai)
<img src="images/apha-ai_features.png?raw=true"/>

Aphasia is a language disorder caused by damage in the area of the brain which controls language expression and comprehension that can lead to patients struggling to understand and express their thoughts into words. I led a team of 6 members to build apha.ai - a web application designed to assist individuals with aphasia in comprehending and interacting with text content. This project was built using React.js, and I used both TensorFlow and PyTorch for building the Large Language Models for this project.

### [Food Type Classification using Machine Learning](/pdf/Food-Classification-Report.pdf)

In this report, I explore different machine learning algorithms to classify foods as solids or liquids based on nutrient data. Using Python, as well as various libraries such as *Pandas*, *Numpy*, *Scikit-learn* and *Matplotlib*, I apply three different machine learning models to the problem: k-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. In the report, I document the process undertaken to achieve a final F1 score of 93.3%, including the data pre-processing pipeline, how Principal Component Analysis and k-fold Cross Validation is applied, and how hyperparameters were chosen.

### [Alzheimer's Disease Classification with Vision Transformers](https://github.com/JoshuaWang8/PatternFlow/tree/topic-recognition/recognition/46965611-ADNI-Brain-Visual-Transformer)

The aim of this project was to develop a Vision Transformer to classify whether MRI scans of a brain showed signs of Alzheimer's Disease or normal cognitive function.

This project was completed entirely in Python and *TensorFlow*, and I was able to implement an entire Vision Transformer with added Shifted Patch Tokenization and Local Self-Attention functionality applied to the model. The data used in this project was sourced from ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative).

This project was completed as an assignment for university coursework and was successfully merged into the PatternFlow course repository. You can find the project that I contributed here: https://github.com/JoshuaWang8/PatternFlow/tree/topic-recognition/recognition/46965611-ADNI-Brain-Visual-Transformer
